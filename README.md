# Bodega Ordering System

## Description of the Project

The Bodega Ordering System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate the process of placing orders for sandwiches, drinks, and chips. The application provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive menus and options to create and manage orders efficiently.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want a home screen that presents me with clear options to either start a new order or exit the application. The application should run continuously until I choose to exit.

- As a user, when I select "New Order" from the home screen, I should be directed to the Order Screen where I can add items to my order.

- As a user, on the Order Screen, I should see options to add a sandwich, a drink, chips, or proceed to checkout. I should also have the option to cancel the order and return to the home screen.

- As a user, when I choose to add a sandwich, I expect to be guided through selecting the bread type, sandwich size, toppings including meat, cheese, other toppings, and sauces, and have the option to toast the sandwich.

- As a user, when I add a drink, I want to choose the size and flavor of the drink from available options.

- As a user, when I add chips to my order, I want to select the type of chips from the available options.

- As a user, when I choose to checkout, I expect to see a summary of my order including all items added and the total price. I should have the option to confirm and generate a receipt file, or cancel the order and return to the home screen.
